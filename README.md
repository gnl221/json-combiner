* This is a program to combine like json files with like fields.
* It generates an output file with all elements from all jsons combined into one group.
* It produces an output file named combined-$date-$time.json
* If the item already exists it will be skipped to prevent duplicates.

This program has no error checking and very little testing. Use at your own risk.
